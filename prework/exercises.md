## Prework

I ask that you complete each of these exercises before the first day of class. They will ensure you're a step ahead and we can get to the good stuff quickly. 

### Python

- Complete [the Python introduction course from Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). While this covers the basics of Python, don't worry if you feel lost! We will be covering these same basics in class, but in further detail. Completing this will give you the vocabulary you need to start.

### A note about prework and Python versions

This prework focuses on Python 2.7. In class, we will be focusing on Python 3.4. There are some differences, but not so many that it will be hard for you to transition. We are using Python 2.7 for the prework as it is what Codecademy supports and what comes installed on your computer. We will install Python 3.4 on the first day of class.

### Command-line

- Read [this Treehouse blog post about command-line basics](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/command-line-basics). When reading the article, go through all the exercises in the article.
- Work through [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a long undertaking and you could spend eight hours working on this. The author has a brash and possibly abrasive tone. The material is good, however.
- Complete the [Try Git walkthrough](https://try.github.io/).

### Bonus prework

The following exercises are not required! However, if you find yourself struggling with the above, or if you have more time you'd like to spend before class, here are some further resources:

- [Getting Started - Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
- [Python for You and Me](http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
